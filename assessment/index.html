<h2 id="good-scholarly-practices">Good Scholarly Practices</h2>
</center>
<p>All work submitted for assessment in this course should be carried out following the University&rsquo;s policies on <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good Scholarly Practice</a>.</p>
<center>
<h1 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h1>
</center>
<p>Over the course of each semester, you will build a portfolio of reflections on required papers. Each week, you will complete two reading responses in class based on the assigned reading, one for the Tuesday class and one for the Thursday class, as well as two group discussion activities on your weekly discussion day.</p>
<p>The goal of the weekly reading responses and group discussion activities is to ensure that you are keeping up with the readings as well as to give you a chance to reflect on the material on your own and in small group conversations.</p>
<p>Portfolios will be marked at the end of the semester. Five of the 20 reading responses, plus the group discussion activities on those days, can be missing, no questions asked and no detriment to the marks.  Otherwise, no extensions.</p>
<center>
<h1 id="essay">Essay</h1>
</center>
<p>The essay assignment will involve reading a small number of papers related to cognitive modelling, and then writing an analysis of these papers.  The choice of papers will be up to you.  Your essay can include references to papers that have been assigned or presented in Semester 1, but the primary papers you choose for your analysis will need to be different.</p>
<p>More details of the essay assignment will be posted in early October, including how to structure the content of your essay, essay format and length, and marking guidelines.</p>
<center>
<h1 id="presentation">Presentation</h1>
</center>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plan on presenting for 25 mins, followed by discussion/questions. We will give you time indicators and cut you off at 30 minutes regardless of whether you are done; if you aren&rsquo;t, it is likely to affect your mark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your presentation should use slides, and your slides should be well organized and use visuals clearly and effectively (see audio-visual aids section below).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="topic-assignment">Topic Assignment</h2>
<p>For the first semester, topics have been prepared for you. You should have a look at the topics on the website and fill out the survey on the first Thursday of class.</p>
<p>For the second semester, you are encouraged to propose your own topic (the website will be updated at the end of Semester 1).</p>
<p>To propose your own topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>you must select one/two papers for the seminar to have people read, and have them approved by instructor.</li>
<li>typically these should also be the topic of your essay</li>
<li>you must draft 2+ questions under discussion</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>Presentations should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction to the topic: what is the psychological phenomenon being modelled, and what question(s) are being addressed in the papers? How do they tie in with some of the big questions we&rsquo;ve discussed?</li>
<li>An explanation of the models presented and results obtained.</li>
<li>Some analysis or comparison of the models, e.g. What are their strengths and weaknesses? Do you find one more believable, and why? Are there remaining issues that neither addresses?</li>
</ul>
<p>Good presentations will also normally include examples, figures, or diagrams to illustrate important concepts or results.</p>
<p>NOTE: 30 minutes is not a long time! You will need to decide how much detail is appropriate, and which information is most important. Please do not try to present everything. Remember, all students in the class should have read the assigned papers. Prepare your background material with this in mind.</p>
<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t want to use your own laptop, you must email us us your slides (include the [scm-pres] tag in the subject of your email) by 7 p.m. the night before your presentation. It is a good idea to do this anyway, to ensure a backup copy in case your laptop/USB fails, and also for marking purposes. If you do not do this, and you have a technical problem that prevents you from presenting, you will receive a 0 on the assignment. We have intentionally set the deadline on the previous night so that you will not be tempted to stay up late working on your slides. Not sleeping enough is a great recipe for a poor presentation.</li>
<li>When sending slides, PDF files are preferable.</li>
<li>If you plan to make extensive use of the whiteboard rather than slides, you must speak to us well ahead of time (at least 4 business days). Some use of the whiteboard is fine without advance notice.</li>
<li>Please arrive five minutes early on the day of your presentation, to allow time to set up.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="delivery">Delivery</h2>
<p>Part of your mark will be based on your delivery. If you wish to do well on this part of the assignment, one word will tell you how: <strong>practice</strong>! Practicing your presentation out loud will not only help you figure out how long it will take, but will also make you more confident and will allow you to work out how to explain difficult concepts ahead of time. See the marking sheet for the criteria we will be using to assess your delivery.</p>
<p>Having a well-organized talk is a very good start to keeping your audience engaged and your message understood, but it&rsquo;s important to understand that people have limited memory and attention. That means they will not remember everything you said in the beginning of your talk by the end (or even the middle). You need to help them out by providing verbal cues (rarely, if ever, are bullets needed!) reminding them what you have already told them, what&rsquo;s coming up, and how everything fits together. I&rsquo;ve heard these referred to as &ldquo;signposts&rdquo;. Examples include: &ldquo;OK, so that&rsquo;s the overview of the system, now I will talk about each of those parts in more detail&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve now explained how they use X and Y to produce Z. Remember that what they are going to do with Z is A, so I&rsquo;ll now give you some more detail about that.&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to talk about this part of the paper in any detail, but if you have questions about it I can answer them in the discussion after the presentation.&rdquo; In other words, think about your transitions, not just your slides. It is also often a good idea to include actual summary slides after each major section of your presentation, recapping the main points before moving on. You should not need more than one or two of these.</p>
<h2 id="audio-visual-aids">Audio-visual aids</h2>
<p>You will also receive a mark for your use of audio-visual aids (slides, whiteboard, or any additional media). Here are some tips on appropriate use of these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps the most common mistake for beginning presenters is to put too much information (especially text) on the slides. If you practice your presentation (see above), you should know it well enough that you do not need to use the slides to remind you of every single thing you want to say. You should especially try to avoid the trap of reading text directly from your slides. Slides are better used for highlighting key points and showing pictures (examples, figures, etc.)</li>
<li>Make sure your slides are easy to read. Fonts should be no smaller than 20-24 point. Different colors can be used for emphasis, but should be used sparingly. Remember that color-blindness is fairly common, so try not to rely on color to distinguish things.</li>
<li>If you reproduce a figure or table from a paper, make sure any labels or text are still visible, or add your own labels in larger fonts.</li>
<li>Sometimes it can be easier to go through an example or draw a picture on the whiteboard than on the slides. This is ok as long as you are prepared: know how the whiteboard is set up in the room and how to switch between the projector and whiteboard without taking lots of time. And know what you are planning to draw!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="citations">Citations</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may find that it is useful to include images, figures, or tables from the papers you are discussing or other sources. If you do so, you must cite your sources, even if the source appears to be clear from context. Papers should be cited as (Lastname, year) on the slide, with a full citation on a separate References slide at the end. Web sources should be cited by URL.</li>
<li>Direct quotations may also be used if cited (as above), but note that long quotations are usually a crutch used by students who do not understand the material enough to restate it in their own words. Use quotations with care.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-to-avoid-common-mistakes">Tips to avoid common mistakes</h2>
<p>The following list of pointers is intended to help avoid common pitfalls in presentations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain all important technical terms that won&rsquo;t be obvious to your fellow students.</li>
<li>Be sure to provide motivation for the models and experiments. Why did the authors do what they did? Why should we care?</li>
<li>Make sure that fellow students who haven&rsquo;t read your specific paper can still follow the presentation.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t necessarily describe every experiment in a paper if it would come at the cost of clarity or coherence.</li>
<li>Always give citations for figures, quotations, and anything else you get from an external source, even if that source is the paper you&rsquo;re presenting.</li>
<li>Practice your presentation, to ensure good pacer and transitions.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t read directly from your slides.</li>
<li>Only include figures or tables copied from the original paper if you can clearly explain their contents. If you&rsquo;re only going to talk about a small part of the figure, it may be better to create your own.</li>
