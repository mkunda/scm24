In An introduction to model-based cognitive Neuroscience (pp. 49-70). Springer, New York, NY. The diffusion model of decision making is introduced in this chapter. The model assumes that decisions are made by accumulating noisy evidence until reaching a response criterion. The time taken to reach criterion determines the decision time, while the response is determined by which criterion is reached first. The chapter describes the main features of the model, methods for obtaining response time predictions, fitting it to experimental data, and representing the fit graphically. The model is compared to other models and is the most widely applied to empirical data in psychology. The diffusion model focuses on two-alternative decision tasks and uses continuous-time versions of random walks to interpret evidence. The model predicts choice probabilities and response time distributions and has been extensively studied. It can account for speed-accuracy trade-offs and bias effects in decision making. The chapter also discusses the links between evidence accumulation and processes in psychology and neuroscience. Overall, the diffusion model provides a useful tool for analyzing decision-making data and understanding the cognitive processes involved. Meyer, D.E. \u0026amp; Schvaneveldt, R.

Science, 192(4234), 27-33 This passage provides an overview of a research study conducted by experimental psychologists on human learning and memory, with a focus on semantic information retrieval. The study used a reaction time method to measure word recognition and sentence comprehension. The researchers manipulated set relations and sizes of categories in sentences and found that reaction times were faster when the meanings of category names were closely related and slower when the sizes of the categories mentioned were more different from each other. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to a model of human memory and the effects of category size on reaction times.

The experiments manipulate variables such as frame size, memory-set size, and mapping procedure to investigate the differences between these modes and their impact on attention. The results suggest that automatic attention can be learned in certain paradigms and that the presence of categories can improve performance in controlled search and facilitate the development of automatic detection.

The prototype view suggests that categories are represented by a prototype, which is a summary representation of the entire category with certain features being more important. The exemplar view states that categories are represented by individual exemplars that we remember and compare to new items. The knowledge approach argues that concepts are shaped by prior knowledge and understanding. The passage also introduces the Generalized Context Model (GCM), which calculates similarity and categorization decisions based on distances between exemplars. It discusses the use of weighted dimensions and the Luce choice axiom in the GCM. The GCM has received both praise and criticism but has been influential in the field of categorization.

The study conducted by Rosch et al. explores the concept of categorization in cognitive psychology, specifically focusing on basic level categories.

They suggest that basic categories are the most inclusive and differentiated, carrying the most information and possessing high category cue validity.\nAnother classic.\nGershman, S. J. (2017) On the Blessing of Abstraction. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 70 (3). The blessing of abstraction refers to the phenomenon that abstract knowledge can sometimes be acquired more quickly than specific knowledge. Gershman tests this hypothesis using hierarchical Bayesian models and an experiment manipulating the dispersion of variables. The experiment involved participants predicting the next button press in sequences of button presses. The size range of the buttons was manipulated to create different levels of dispersion. The results showed that in the low dispersion condition, abstract knowledge was acquired more quickly than specific knowledge. However, in the high dispersion condition, specific knowledge was acquired more quickly. These findings support the idea that the blessing of abstraction depends on the dispersion of specific variables. Gershman suggests that hierarchical Bayesian models provide a framework for understanding how learning occurs at different levels of abstraction simultaneously.\nA short recent paper that touches on how categories are arranged hierarchically.\nQuestions under discussion What is a category?

It proposes that resource-rational analysis provides a method for understanding how the human mind uses its limited cognitive resources.

This article discusses the use of approximate algorithms for online causal learning, using Neurath\u0026rsquo;s Ship as a formalization framework. The study proposes an algorithmic-level model of causal structure learning and examines the computational challenges and the need for approximations in causal learning. They use the concept of Neurath\u0026rsquo;s Ship to describe the incremental growth and evolution of beliefs about causal structure. Overall, the article presents various models and approaches to understanding human causal judgments and active learning.

Bayesian Models of Conceptual Development: Learning as Building Models of the World. Annual Review of Developmental Psychology, 2 (1). The use of Bayesian inference in model-building, including hierarchical Bayesian models and probabilistic generative programs, is discussed. The role of core knowledge in child learning and the relationship between intuitive theories and core knowledge are explored. Learning is described as a stochastic search process, with theory learning being a search for programs.\nThe text also discusses the theory theory and the child as scientist theory, as well as the use of Bayesian models and probabilistic programs to capture the structure of intuitive theories. The tensions between different methods of scientific experimentation are explored, and the same cognitive processes are noted to have different outcomes depending on the circumstances. The author suggests that a single program learning mechanism can be used to explain data but that its effectiveness depends on relevant data representations, input analyzers, and primitives available.\nThe text acknowledges the challenges of model-building in science and suggests that a comprehensive account of how humans develop models of the world would need to consider various factors such as individual differences, cultural influences, and computational constraints.

The study involved training albino rats to discriminate between black and white stimuli under different conditions of delay of reward. The results showed that the number of trials required to reach the learning criterion varied based on the duration of the delay, and the type of secondary reinforcement had an effect on the learning process.

This study examines how timing information influences judgments of causal strength and structure induction. Four experiments were conducted, revealing the importance of event order and temporal intervals in learning causal relationships. A Bayesian model accurately predicted participants\u0026rsquo; judgments, highlighting the significance of time in understanding causal learning. Participants\u0026rsquo; judgments were largely explained by event order, but there was some evidence of delay sensitivity and participants were able to distinguish between causal structures based on event timings alone.

The study investigated numerical cognition in Munduruku speakers, who have a limited lexicon of number words. The Munduruku can compare and add approximate numbers but struggle with exact arithmetic. The study contributes to understanding the relationship between language and arithmetic and the role of language in numerical cognition. It highlights that while the Munduruku lack number words beyond 5, they still possess a nonverbal system for approximate number. This suggests that exact arithmetic may require language for a precise representation and manipulation of numbers. The study also emphasizes the potential impact of language on numerical cognition and how cultural and linguistic factors can influence numeric representation and processes. Frank, M. C., Everett, D.

This article explores the relationship between language and our understanding of numbers, focusing on the Pirahã tribe\u0026rsquo;s language and numerical abilities. Previous research has shown that the Pirahã language lacks words for exact numbers, but the tribe can perform exact matching tasks with large quantities of objects accurately. This suggests that language for exact numbers is a cultural invention, not a universal linguistic feature. Number words serve as a cognitive technology for representing and keeping track of large sets accurately. The article discusses the role of language in understanding numbers and the theories proposing that language plays a causal role in the acquisition of exact numerical competence.

The study focuses on exploring the relationship between attention and feature integration in perception. It introduces diagnostic tests for determining the separability of dimensions and conducts experiments to support the theory of feature integration. The study also examines visual search, texture segregation, illusory conjunctions, identity and location perception, and interference from unattended stimuli.

They introduce a new method called meaning maps, which represent the spatial distribution of meaning in scenes and compare it to image salience and attention. The author found that both meaning and salience predict attention, but meaning uniquely accounts for variance in attention.

This paper presents a spreading-activation theory of human semantic processing that can account for recent experimental findings. The theory extends Quillian\u0026rsquo;s theory of semantic memory search and priming, addressing misconceptions and proposing additional assumptions. It is shown to explain production and categorization experiments and critiques the Smith et al. model for categorization judgments. The theory suggests that activation spreads through a network of links in semantic memory, with activation decreasing as it moves outward. Concepts are stored in a lexical network based on similarity, and activation depends on priming and connections between concepts. The theory also discusses strategies for evaluating semantic matching and the role of properties and superordinate connections. It is applied to various experiments, including those on reaction times, category-instance relationships, negative instances, typicality, and semantic relatedness. The theory emphasizes the importance of considering different configurations of knowledge in memory and aims to provide a more powerful and flexible approach to understanding human semantic processing. Zhang, W., \u0026amp; Luck, S. J. (2008). Discrete fixed-resolution representations in visual working memory. Nature, 453(7192), 233-235. Researchers have been debating whether working memory stores a fixed set of representations or a flexible pool of resources. This study aimed to resolve this controversy by conducting four experiments using a short-term recall paradigm.\nThe results of Experiment 1 showed that humans store high-resolution representations of some objects and no information about others, ruling out models with varying resolutions. Experiment 2 supported the idea of fixed-resolution representations, as precision did not decrease with set size. Experiment 3 found that resources were allocated to cued items, enhancing precision. Experiment 4 demonstrated that durable memory representations involve an all-or-none encoding process for simple objects.\nOverall, the study supports the notion of a small number of fixed-resolution representations in working memory. These representations are not affected by set size and are created through an all-or-none encoding process. The experiments provide insights into the capacity and resolution of visual working memory.\nQuestions under discussion What are the differences between short term and long term memory.

In class, we discussed the paper at some length, especially the idea that many psychological observations about \u0026ldquo;humans\u0026rdquo; are really observations about particular subgroups of humans\u0026mdash;still valuable, but not necessarily as universal as we might think. The very next class period, and with a great deal of excitement, one of the undergrads in our class wanted to tell us something that had happened to her just the day before. She had been sitting in one of her psychology classes, and the lecture had introduced the idea that humans have a positive self concept. She said that the idea was presented in her psychology class as if it were universal to all humans. She was excited that she had just read about this exact finding in the Henrich paper and was able to detect the over-simplification.\nWhile the paper makes many good points about which people we study, other researchers have also pointed out that the nature of the experiments themselves, i.e., what tasks we ask people to do, also reflects a very specific social and cultural background, e.g.,:\nBaumard, N., \u0026amp; Sperber, D. (2010). Weird people, yes, but also weird experiments. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 33(2-3), 84–85.\nGoing even further, the scientific community is increasingly starting to appreciate that our perspectives strongly influence and define even more basic aspects of our entire scientific philosophy and research process, like:\nwhat research questions we decide to ask in the first place how we conceptualize our ideas about research designs how we apply our notions of measurement onto the world how we believe scientific research produces knowledge and so on. One way to begin addressing these issues is to rethink our research process. Conventional research might unfold with outside scientists going into communities and \u0026ldquo;extracting\u0026rdquo; the data they want. Instead, we can think about research as a collaborative activity between scientists and communities, where community members are active participants in all stages of the research, including research framing and design\u0026mdash;what is called participatory research.\nFor instance: Broesch, T., Crittenden, A.

Ideally, the community is not only central to the planned research, but is leading it. \u0026hellip;[I]n many instances, community-based participatory research is shifting towards this type of relationship between researchers and study communities.\n","date":1727481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1727481600,"objectID":"a0f84b455356e27bf7aba462863c38b2","permalink":"https://mkunda.github.io/scm24/projects/people/","publishdate":"2024-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/people/","section":"projects","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"People","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Maithilee Kunda"],"categories":[],"content":"What does it mean to have a computational-representational understanding of the mind?

Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs.” (Dennett, The Intentional Stance, 1996, p. 17).\nThis session will think about how people reason about others and how we might make machines that can do the same.\nPrimary Readings Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss.\nDennett, D. C. (1981). Chapter 3: True believers: The intentional strategy and why it works. In Mind Design II Some philosophy for a change. If you\u0026rsquo;ve not heard of Dennett, he is one of the most influential philosophers of cognitive science and has some interesting views on consciousness, free will and many other things (evolution, religion). He is also known for this \u0026lsquo;intentional stance\u0026rsquo; idea which helps clarify what it means to think about the private mental states of others. Jara-Ettinger, J., Gweon, H., Schulz, L. E., \u0026amp; Tenenbaum, J. B. (2016). The naïve utility calculus: Computational principles underlying commonsense psychology. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 20(8), 589-604. Fast forward 30 years from Mind Design, and we see the intentional stance ideas startign to be formalized in computational Bayesian framework, capturing how one can invert behaviours to identify someone\u0026rsquo;s likely beliefs, values etc. Note also the connections with Development and Rationality topics. Secondary Readings The presenter should read and incorporate at least two of these.\nBaker, C. L., Saxe, R., \u0026amp; Tenenbaum, J. B. (2009). Action understanding as inverse planning. Cognition, 113(3), 329-349. This article presents a computational framework for modeling human action understanding using Bayesian inverse planning. The authors conducted psychophysical experiments to assess the accuracy of different inverse planning models in predicting human goal inferences. The results show evidence for a rational inference mechanism in human goal inference. The framework provides a formal approach to understanding rational action and goal inference in humans.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a more detailed example of this project modelling theory of mind style inferences as rational inverse planning. The food truck scenarios are proven popular and sprouted \u0026lsquo;spinoff\u0026rsquo; projects in the decade since this paper.\nHeider, F., \u0026amp; Simmel, M. (1944). An experimental study of apparent behavior. The American Journal of Psychology, 57(2), 243-259. The study aimed to understand how individuals perceive and interpret the behavior of others based on visual stimuli. The authors highlight the lack of experimental investigations in this area and emphasize the importance of studying the psychology of perception in relation to apparent behavior. The study involved showing participants a moving picture-film featuring geometric shapes moving in various directions and speeds. Participants were asked to describe the pictures and answer questions about them. The findings revealed that participants tended to interpret the movements as actions of animate beings, attributing personalities and motives to the shapes. The study demonstrates that humans have a tendency to perceive and attribute behavior to abstract shapes, suggesting a fundamental psychological process involved in perceiving others\u0026rsquo; behavior.\nThis very old article is really most famous for its stimuli (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTNmLt7QX8E). One still tends to see this clip in the introduction to talks about social cognition (its not a bad idea to include it in your own presentation!). It is striking how irresistible it is to take ``the intentional stance\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; a la Dennett, and assign motivations and personality traits to these simple geometric shapes being moved around on an overhead projector.\nBaron-Cohen, S., Leslie, A. M., \u0026amp; Frith, U. (1985). Does the autistic child have a “theory of mind”? Cognition, 21(1), 37-46. This article explores whether autistic children lack a \u0026ldquo;theory of mind,\u0026rdquo; which refers to the ability to understand and predict the beliefs and behaviors of others. The study compares the performance of autistic children to that of normal children and children with Down\u0026rsquo;s syndrome using a puppet play paradigm. The research suggests that despite having a higher mental age than the comparison groups, autistic children fail to impute beliefs to others, indicating a deficit in meta-representational development specific to autism. This deficit contributes to the social impairment experienced by autistic children. The authors propose a new model of meta-representational development that suggests the capacity to form \u0026ldquo;second-order representations\u0026rdquo; is necessary for a theory of mind. Autistic children not only struggle with social ineptness but also exhibit a lack of pretend play.\nAgain this paper is most famous for its stimuli, the \u0026lsquo;Sally-Ann False Belief Task\u0026rsquo; which probes whether someone is capable of Theory of Mind reasoning. Who is Simon Baron-Cohen\u0026rsquo;s famous cousin?\nQuestions under discussion Can you think of situations where people make the wrong theory of mind ascriptions (i.e. something with little or no mental life that we we assume does have it, and visa versa)? What are some challenges for developing artificial agents with theory of mind Is the Baron-Cohen view of autism still current?

L., \u0026amp; Gentner, D. (1993) Respects for similarity. Psychological Review, 100(2), 254. This article discusses the concept of similarity and its importance in various psychological theories. The authors argue against the view that similarity is determined solely by perceptual processes and propose that it is influenced by the comparison process itself. They address criticisms of similarity and suggest that specific similarities between objects, known as \u0026ldquo;respects,\u0026rdquo; are crucial for understanding similarity. The passages also explore different models and measures of similarity, the role of context and experience in similarity judgments, and the influence of comparison processes on similarity assessments. They discuss the importance of alignment in determining similarities and differences between objects and the role of constraints and global constraint satisfaction in similarity judgments. The passages highlight the dynamic and context-dependent nature of similarity and the need for further research in this area.

This research article explores the optimality of human cognition in everyday situations and whether cognitive judgments align with optimal statistical principles. The study investigates various domains, including life spans, movie grosses, poem lengths, baking times, waiting times, and reigns of pharaohs. The results demonstrate that people\u0026rsquo;s predictions in most domains closely match the optimal Bayesian predictions based on empirical prior distributions.\nThis one could easily be in the Rationality\u0026quot; topic, but I put it here to highlight that effective inductive biases are effective because they reflect actual environmental statistics.\nFeldman, J. (2012) Symbolic representation of probabilistic worlds. Cognition, 123(1), 61-83. The article discusses the use of symbolic representation in cognitive science, specifically in probabilistic worlds. The author introduces the concept of modality and argues that symbolic representation depends on the probabilistic structure of the environment. The paper proposes that modal environments, which consist of mixtures of narrow component distributions, can be represented symbolically with minimal information loss. The author also explores the relationship between discrete symbols and continuous variables, as well as the challenges of working with mixtures. The article discusses the implications of modality in the environment and how it affects an observer\u0026rsquo;s ability to represent and comprehend it. It concludes that environments with multiple modes or peaks can be effectively represented by symbols, while arbitrary environments cannot. The paper also examines the reduction of dimensions and how modal environments can be approximated by symbolic variables. Overall, the paper aims to show that symbolic representations in cognitive science are effective in capturing the probabilistic structure of modal worlds. Harnad, S. (1990) The symbol grounding problem. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 42(1-3), 335-346. This paper by Stevan Harnad, published in 1990, explores the symbol grounding problem and the role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. It suggests that symbols can be grounded in nonsymbolic representations, such as iconic and categorical representations, in order to give them meaning. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of both connectionism and symbolism, and proposes a hybrid model that combines these approaches to address the limitations of each. It also discusses the transition from behaviorism to cognitivism in the modeling of the mind, and explores the defining characteristics of a symbol system. The paper concludes that addressing the symbol grounding problem is crucial for understanding complex cognitive capacities, and that a cooperative approach between connectionism and symbolism is necessary for a comprehensive cognitive model. Overall, the paper highlights the challenges and potential solutions in giving meaning to symbols within a formal symbol system, and discusses the importance of grounding symbols in nonsymbolic representations. Questions under discussion Is the environment worth studying? What is the target for the grounding problem?

Gladwell once claimed that 10,000 hours of practice in anything is enough to make anyone an expert. While this has been roundly debunked, large neural network models are now able to achieve expert or superhuman ability when given enough millions of training episodes for a single task.\nOn the other hand, these models struggle far more than people to generalize this expertis to even slightly different tasks, or indeed to master more than one thing at all. What is expertise in cognition? This session will explore how we can model expertise, how expertise changes our how a cognizer approaches a task, and what trade-offs this can come with.\nPrimary Readings Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss:\nChi, M.

Each week, you will complete two reading responses in class based on the assigned readings, one for the Tuesday class and one for the Thursday class. You will also complete group discussion activities on your weekly discussion day, and presentation feedback activities on presentation day.\nOccasionally, the reading response portion of your portfolio might be assigned as a take-home activity to complete before class, but the majority of them will be done as in-class activities. You are welcome to have the paper in front of you (in printed or electronic form), as well as any notes you yourself took, but you should not access the Internet, ChatGPT, or other sources during the reading response. The reading responses are to be completed individually. You may not work with others or discuss your response while you are writing it. The goal of the weekly reading responses, group discussions, and presentation feedback activities is to ensure that you are keeping up with the readings as well as to give you a chance to reflect on the material on your own and in small group conversations.\nPortfolios will be marked at the end of the semester. Five of the 20 reading responses, plus any group discussion or presentation feedback activities on those days, can be missing, no questions asked and no detriment to the marks. Otherwise, no extensions.\nFor reading responses and group discussion activities, these portfolio entries will be marked according to:\nDoes the entry demonstrate knowledge of the reading(s)? Does the entry demonstrate thoughtful engagement with the prompt? For presentation feedback activities, these portfolio entries will be marked according to:\nDoes the entry demonstrate attention to / engagement with the presentation? Essay The essay assignment will involve reading a small number of papers related to cognitive modelling, and then writing an analysis of these papers.\nThe choice of papers will be up to you (pending instructor approval). Your essay can include references and some discussion of papers that have been assigned or presented in Semester 1, but the primary papers you choose for your essay will need to be different. Content Your essay should be based around one or two papers of your choice on a topic in cognitive modelling. Your essay should discuss empirical findings in the context of a computational model or models to a non specialist audience.\nOption 1: Essay based on one long paper. One way to do this is to find a single paper that includes both empirical and modelling results. The paper in question should be very meaty, i.e., fairly long and including many experiments or a thorough comparison with other approaches.\nOption 2: Essay based on two shorter papers. Alternatively, you can look at two shorter papers covering different models of a single phenomenon, or additional experiments testing the same model.\nWhether you choose one or two main papers, your essay should discuss the context of the work (i.e., behavioural findings or philosophical questions addressed), summarise the model(s) and experiment(s), and critically evaluate the work. You should also aim to address the following questions: how does this work relate to other models/approaches we have studied in class? What questions are raised by this work? What further experimental or modelling work might help to address these questions? Your goal is to demonstrate that you can read a cognitive modelling paper, understand its methods, evaluate its claims and place it in context in the field.\nA good essay will also include material that you get from “reading around” the topic, i.e., looking at some of the references in your chosen paper(s), as well as using Google Scholar or similar to look at more recent papers that have cited your chosen paper(s).\nFormat Coming soon.\nMarking Coming soon.\nPresentation You will do two presentations over the course of the year, each on a cognitive modelling paper. In Semester 1, your paper will be assigned to you. In Semester 2, you will be able to present on a paper of your choice, with instructor approval.\nYour Semester 1 presentation will be marked for feedback, but the mark will not count towards your course grade. Your Semester 2 presentation will be marked and will count towards your course grade.\nFormat Plan on presenting for 25 minutes, followed by 10 minutes discussion/questions. We will give you time indicators and cut you off at 30 minutes regardless of whether you are done; if you aren\u0026rsquo;t, it is likely to affect your mark.\nYour presentation should use slides, and your slides should be well organized and use visuals clearly and effectively.\nTopic Assignment For the first semester, topics and papers have been prepared for you. You should have a look at the topics on the website and fill out the topic selection survey (link can be found on Learn) by the end of class on Thursday, September 26.\nFor the second semester, you will be asked to propose your own topic and paper.\nTo propose your own topic (Semester 2 Presentations Only):\nYou should select one background paper for the seminar to have people read. This can be a review paper, a paper describing behavioral experiments, etc. You should prepare a reflection question that you would like to class to think about in their reading response for this paper. You should select one cognitive modelling paper that you will present to the class. Your paper choices will need to be approved by the instructor. These papers can also be part of the topic of your essay. Content Presentations should include:\nAn introduction to the topic: what is the psychological phenomenon being modelled, and what question(s) are being addressed in the paper? How do they tie in with some of the big questions we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed in class? An explanation of the proposed model (or models), including what types of representations and processes it uses, and why these are considered to be significant in terms of cognitive science. A discussion of experiments done with the model and results obtained. Some analysis of the model and results, e.g. What are its strengths and weaknesses? What does it include? What does it leave out? Your opinions and reactions to this paper. Were you convinced by the arguments made in the paper? Were there parts of the paper that you disagreed with? What other information or experiments would you have liked to see? Good presentations will also normally include examples, figures, or diagrams to illustrate important concepts or results.\nNOTE: 25 minutes is not a long time! You will need to decide how much detail is appropriate, and which information is most important. Please do not try to present everything. Remember, all students in the class will have read the required papers, but not your assigned presentation paper. Prepare your background slides with this in mind.\nCitations You may find that it is useful to include images, figures, or tables from the papers you are discussing or other sources. If you do so, you must cite your sources, even if the source appears to be clear from context. Papers should be cited as (Lastname, year) on the slide, with a full citation on a separate References slide at the end. Web sources should be cited by URL. Direct quotations may also be used if cited (as above), but note that long quotations are often a crutch used instead of actually understanding the material and being able to restate it in your own words. Use quotations with care. Logistics You may run your presentation off of your own laptop or off of the standard computer in the room. On your presentation day, please plan to arrive a few minutes early so that you have time to test out your presentation before class. If you plan to use the whiteboard in addition to your slides, it is your responsibility to make sure that the classroom has a whiteboard and that you have markers that work (especially in Semester 1 as we are in different classrooms in different weeks). Submitting slides the night before - REQUIRED You will need to submit your slides on Learn by 7:00 p.m. the night before your presentation. Please submit your slides in PDF format. (It\u0026rsquo;s ok if animations, videos, etc. don\u0026rsquo;t show up in the PDF version of your slides. You can run the actual presentation using whatever presentation software you prefer to use.) We have intentionally set the deadline on the previous night so that you will not be tempted to stay up late working on your slides. Not sleeping enough is a great recipe for a poor presentation.
