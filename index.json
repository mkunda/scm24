In An introduction to model-based cognitive Neuroscience (pp. 49-70). Springer, New York, NY. The diffusion model of decision making is introduced in this chapter. The model assumes that decisions are made by accumulating noisy evidence until reaching a response criterion. The time taken to reach criterion determines the decision time, while the response is determined by which criterion is reached first. The chapter describes the main features of the model, methods for obtaining response time predictions, fitting it to experimental data, and representing the fit graphically. The model is compared to other models and is the most widely applied to empirical data in psychology. The diffusion model focuses on two-alternative decision tasks and uses continuous-time versions of random walks to interpret evidence. The model predicts choice probabilities and response time distributions and has been extensively studied. It can account for speed-accuracy trade-offs and bias effects in decision making. The chapter also discusses the links between evidence accumulation and processes in psychology and neuroscience. Overall, the diffusion model provides a useful tool for analyzing decision-making data and understanding the cognitive processes involved. Meyer, D.E. \u0026amp; Schvaneveldt, R.

The study used a reaction time method to measure word recognition and sentence comprehension. The researchers manipulated set relations and sizes of categories in sentences and found that reaction times were faster when the meanings of category names were closely related and slower when the sizes of the categories mentioned were more different from each other. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to a model of human memory and the effects of category size on reaction times.

The experiments manipulate variables such as frame size, memory-set size, and mapping procedure to investigate the differences between these modes and their impact on attention. The results suggest that automatic attention can be learned in certain paradigms and that the presence of categories can improve performance in controlled search and facilitate the development of automatic detection.

The article highlights two aspects of human conceptual knowledge that have eluded machine systems: the ability to learn new concepts from just one or a few examples, and the ability to learn rich and flexible representations. The authors propose the Bayesian Program Learning (BPL) framework, which can learn a wide range of visual concepts from just a single example and generalize in ways that are similar to human behavior. BPL represents concepts as stochastic programs and utilizes compositionality, causality, and learning to learn as key ideas.\nThe authors present a computational model that captures these human learning abilities specifically for simple visual concepts, using handwritten characters from different alphabets as examples. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples, using a Bayesian criterion. In a one-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance and outperforms recent deep learning approaches. The model\u0026rsquo;s creative generalization abilities are tested through several \u0026ldquo;visual Turing tests,\u0026rdquo; which show that in many cases, the model\u0026rsquo;s behavior is indistinguishable from human behavior.\nThis is the first really modern modelling paper on the reading list. It showcases the power of hierarchical Bayesian program induction as a theory of conceptual structure. In being based in symbolic rules/programs, it is a successor to Goodman et al (2008), but the domain is much more naturalistic and the computational cost of fitting this model is far higher. Note also the differences in writing style compared to the classic papers, e.g. compressed, concise, visual, snappy but key details in an appendix.\nShepard, R. N., Hovland, C. I. and Jenkins, H. M. (1961) Learning and Memorization of Classifications. Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 75(13), 1. The study includes a series of experiments that investigate the learning and memorization of different types of classifications. The results show that the structure of the classification and the complexity of the rules involved affect the difficulty of the task. Overall, the study provides insights into the factors that determine the difficulty of learning and remembering classifications. It highlights the importance of considering the structure of the classification, the complexity of the rules, and the use of different stimuli in understanding the learning and memorization process.\nThe experiments in this paper are long and complicated but what makes it famous is the way Shepard visualizes concepts/classification rules of different complexity (i.e. Figures 2 and 3). These visualizations and the logic behind them are widely used in categorization research and teaching today.\nQuestions under discussion How do concepts relate to categories?

MIT Press (On Learn) This chapter discusses theories of concepts, specifically focusing on the prototype view, exemplar view, and the knowledge approach. The prototype view suggests that categories are represented by a prototype, which is a summary representation of the entire category with certain features being more important. The exemplar view states that categories are represented by individual exemplars that we remember and compare to new items. The knowledge approach argues that concepts are shaped by prior knowledge and understanding. The passage also introduces the Generalized Context Model (GCM), which calculates similarity and categorization decisions based on distances between exemplars. It discusses the use of weighted dimensions and the Luce choice axiom in the GCM. The GCM has received both praise and criticism but has been influential in the field of categorization.

The study conducted by Rosch et al. explores the concept of categorization in cognitive psychology, specifically focusing on basic level categories. The researchers argue that categories in the concrete world are not arbitrary, but determined by the correlational structure of perceived objects and the need for cognitive efficiency. They suggest that basic categories are the most inclusive and differentiated, carrying the most information and possessing high category cue validity.\nAnother classic.\nGershman, S. J. (2017) On the Blessing of Abstraction. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 70 (3). The blessing of abstraction refers to the phenomenon that abstract knowledge can sometimes be acquired more quickly than specific knowledge. Gershman tests this hypothesis using hierarchical Bayesian models and an experiment manipulating the dispersion of variables. The experiment involved participants predicting the next button press in sequences of button presses. The size range of the buttons was manipulated to create different levels of dispersion. The results showed that in the low dispersion condition, abstract knowledge was acquired more quickly than specific knowledge. However, in the high dispersion condition, specific knowledge was acquired more quickly. These findings support the idea that the blessing of abstraction depends on the dispersion of specific variables. Gershman suggests that hierarchical Bayesian models provide a framework for understanding how learning occurs at different levels of abstraction simultaneously.\nA short recent paper that touches on how categories are arranged hierarchically.\nQuestions under discussion What is a category?

This paper presents research on the activity of single fibers in the optic nerve of frogs. The authors investigate what kind of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and what aspect of that stimulus is most excitatory. They find that the pattern of local variation in intensity, rather than the light intensity itself, is the most excitatory factor for the frog\u0026rsquo;s eye. The study provides a detailed analysis of the anatomy, physiology, and behavior of the frog\u0026rsquo;s visual apparatus. The research emphasizes that the frog\u0026rsquo;s eye informs the brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern, independent of average illumination. The findings suggest that the frog\u0026rsquo;s visual system is highly organized and interpreted, and not simply transmitting an accurate copy of the distribution of light. Biederman, I. (1987) Recognition-by-Components: A Theory of Human Image Understanding. Psychological Review, 94(2), 115. This article discusses the theory of recognition-by-components (RBC) in human image understanding. The theory proposes that objects are perceived by segmenting the input image into simple geometric components called geons. These geons can be derived from the contrasts of certain properties of edges in the image. The theory suggests that object recognition is robust and invariant to changes in viewing position and image quality. Experimental findings support the theory. Scholl, Brian J.

The goal is to bridge the gap between cognitive science and metaphysics and potentially contribute to philosophical progress. The article discusses themes such as spatiotemporal continuity, persistence through property change, and cohesion, and how these themes have led to empirical discoveries in psychological research. It also explores various scenarios and challenges our intuitions about the identity and persistence of objects over time. The article highlights the importance of cohesion as a principle for object persistence and discusses the role of intuitions and psychological mechanisms in influencing our judgments and interpretations.

This article explores how people learn causal structures through interventions. The researchers developed a computer task where participants learned the structure of probabilistic causal systems. They developed models to understand participants\u0026rsquo; intervention choices and judgments, considering memory and processing limitations. The study found that successful participants used a model that maximized information gain, forgot evidence from earlier trials, and had conservative beliefs.

In this research paper, Herbert A. Simon discusses the need to revise the traditional economic model of \u0026ldquo;economic man\u0026rdquo; as a rational decision-maker. He proposes a behavioral model of rational choice that takes into account the limited information and computational capacities of individuals. Simon emphasizes the importance of considering the decision-maker\u0026rsquo;s characteristics and the specific situation they are in when defining rational behavior. He explores variables that can be controlled and optimized for rational adaptation, as well as fixed variables that must be taken into account. The paper also discusses the application of this model to game theory, decision-making, and chess. Simon suggests simplifications and approximations that align with observed human behavior and addresses objections to simple pay-off functions in certain choice situations. He also highlights the importance of information gathering and refining the mapping of possible outcomes in decision-making. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this behavioral model for understanding human decision-making in various contexts and the potential normative and descriptive value of this model.

It proposes that resource-rational analysis provides a method for understanding how the human mind uses its limited cognitive resources. It suggests that cognitive biases may be a result of limited cognitive resources rather than irrationality, and understanding these limitations can lead to improved AI and a redefinition of cognitive biases.\nQuestions under discussion What does it mean to be rational?

The study proposes an algorithmic-level model of causal structure learning and examines the computational challenges and the need for approximations in causal learning. They use the concept of Neurath\u0026rsquo;s Ship to describe the incremental growth and evolution of beliefs about causal structure. Overall, the article presents various models and approaches to understanding human causal judgments and active learning.

Bayesian Models of Conceptual Development: Learning as Building Models of the World. Annual Review of Developmental Psychology, 2 (1). The use of Bayesian inference in model-building, including hierarchical Bayesian models and probabilistic generative programs, is discussed. The role of core knowledge in child learning and the relationship between intuitive theories and core knowledge are explored. Learning is described as a stochastic search process, with theory learning being a search for programs.\nThe text also discusses the theory theory and the child as scientist theory, as well as the use of Bayesian models and probabilistic programs to capture the structure of intuitive theories. The tensions between different methods of scientific experimentation are explored, and the same cognitive processes are noted to have different outcomes depending on the circumstances. The author suggests that a single program learning mechanism can be used to explain data but that its effectiveness depends on relevant data representations, input analyzers, and primitives available.\nThe text acknowledges the challenges of model-building in science and suggests that a comprehensive account of how humans develop models of the world would need to consider various factors such as individual differences, cultural influences, and computational constraints.

The study involved training albino rats to discriminate between black and white stimuli under different conditions of delay of reward. The results showed that the number of trials required to reach the learning criterion varied based on the duration of the delay, and the type of secondary reinforcement had an effect on the learning process.

This study examines how timing information influences judgments of causal strength and structure induction. Four experiments were conducted, revealing the importance of event order and temporal intervals in learning causal relationships. A Bayesian model accurately predicted participants\u0026rsquo; judgments, highlighting the significance of time in understanding causal learning. Participants\u0026rsquo; judgments were largely explained by event order, but there was some evidence of delay sensitivity and participants were able to distinguish between causal structures based on event timings alone.

If you are interested in this topic it is worth having a look at some of these these commentaries, as well as the article to get a sense of a wider set of viewpoints and the relevant debates. E.g. in the early 2000\u0026rsquo;s there was a debate in cognitive science between proponents of probabilistic/Bayesian models of cognition championed by people like Nick Chater and Tom Griffiths, and heuristic models such as promoted by the Gigerenzer group in Berlin grounded in earlier work by Herb Simon, as well as Kahneman and Tversky.

In Behavioral Decision Making (pp. 25-41). Springer, Boston, MA. The psychological principles that govern the perception of decision problems and the evaluation of probabilities and outcomes produce predictable shifts of preference when the same problem is framed in different ways. Reversals of preference are demonstrated in choices regarding monetary outcomes, both hypothetical and real, and in questions pertaining to the loss of human lives. The effects of frames on preferences are compared to the effects of perspectives on perceptual appearance. The dependence of preferences on the formulation of decision problems is a significant concern for the theory of rational choice.\nNotworthy that, for this work, Kahneman was the only psychologist to ever win a Nobel Prize (winning in the Economics category in 2002).\nKahneman, D., \u0026amp; Tversky, A.

It highlights the limitations and inconsistencies of expected utility theory and introduces prospect theory as an alternative model. The theory argues that choices involving risky prospects exhibit effects inconsistent with utility theory, such as underweighting probable outcomes and discarding shared components. Prospect theory assigns value to gains and losses rather than final assets, replaces probabilities with decision weights, and explains the tendency to overweight low probabilities. The passage presents various choice problems that violate the axioms of expected utility theory and discusses the observations that led to the development of prospect theory. Overall, the passage emphasizes the departure from rational decision-making and the need for an alternative theory to explain risk preferences in decision-making. Busemeyer, J.

This article presents a comparison between a quantum dynamic model and a Markov model for decision-making processes. The quantum model describes the evolution of complex valued probability amplitudes over time, while the Markov model describes the evolution of real valued probabilities over time. The quantum model generates interference effects, which are not possible with Markov models. The authors derive choice probabilities and distribution of choice response time for the quantum model and compare them to the Markov model. The article discusses several examples and applications of both models, including signal detection and measuring confidence ratings. The authors also compare the fit of the models to response time distributions and highlight the potential of the quantum model in various fields.

The study investigated numerical cognition in Munduruku speakers, who have a limited lexicon of number words. The Munduruku can compare and add approximate numbers but struggle with exact arithmetic. The study contributes to understanding the relationship between language and arithmetic and the role of language in numerical cognition. It highlights that while the Munduruku lack number words beyond 5, they still possess a nonverbal system for approximate number. This suggests that exact arithmetic may require language for a precise representation and manipulation of numbers.

This article explores the relationship between language and our understanding of numbers, focusing on the Pirahã tribe\u0026rsquo;s language and numerical abilities. Previous research has shown that the Pirahã language lacks words for exact numbers, but the tribe can perform exact matching tasks with large quantities of objects accurately. This suggests that language for exact numbers is a cultural invention, not a universal linguistic feature. Number words serve as a cognitive technology for representing and keeping track of large sets accurately. The article discusses the role of language in understanding numbers and the theories proposing that language plays a causal role in the acquisition of exact numerical competence.

This study provides valuable insights into the functioning of short-term memory and underlying cognitive processes. The research by Murdock, Tulving, and Glanzer focuses on the probability of recalling items in a list based on their position. They identify a primacy effect for the first few words and a recency effect for the last few words on the list, which is attributed to retrieval from short-term storage. They also propose a mathematical model to explain these effects, supported by experiments involving overt rehearsal during list presentation. Collins, A. M., \u0026amp; Loftus, E. F. (1975). A spreading-activation theory of semantic processing. Psychological Review, 82(6), 407. This paper presents a spreading-activation theory of human semantic processing that can account for recent experimental findings. The theory extends Quillian\u0026rsquo;s theory of semantic memory search and priming, addressing misconceptions and proposing additional assumptions. It is shown to explain production and categorization experiments and critiques the Smith et al. model for categorization judgments. The theory suggests that activation spreads through a network of links in semantic memory, with activation decreasing as it moves outward. Concepts are stored in a lexical network based on similarity, and activation depends on priming and connections between concepts. The theory also discusses strategies for evaluating semantic matching and the role of properties and superordinate connections. It is applied to various experiments, including those on reaction times, category-instance relationships, negative instances, typicality, and semantic relatedness. The theory emphasizes the importance of considering different configurations of knowledge in memory and aims to provide a more powerful and flexible approach to understanding human semantic processing. Zhang, W., \u0026amp; Luck, S. J. (2008). Discrete fixed-resolution representations in visual working memory. Nature, 453(7192), 233-235. Researchers have been debating whether working memory stores a fixed set of representations or a flexible pool of resources. This study aimed to resolve this controversy by conducting four experiments using a short-term recall paradigm.\nThe results of Experiment 1 showed that humans store high-resolution representations of some objects and no information about others, ruling out models with varying resolutions. Experiment 2 supported the idea of fixed-resolution representations, as precision did not decrease with set size. Experiment 3 found that resources were allocated to cued items, enhancing precision. Experiment 4 demonstrated that durable memory representations involve an all-or-none encoding process for simple objects.\nOverall, the study supports the notion of a small number of fixed-resolution representations in working memory. These representations are not affected by set size and are created through an all-or-none encoding process. The experiments provide insights into the capacity and resolution of visual working memory.\nQuestions under discussion What are the differences between short term and long term memory. How are they thought to be interrelated? How does memory relate to the concepts, categories, learning and representation topics?

If you\u0026rsquo;ve not heard of Dennett, he is one of the most influential philosophers of cognitive science and has some interesting views on consciousness, free will and many other things (evolution, religion). He is also known for this \u0026lsquo;intentional stance\u0026rsquo; idea which helps clarify what it means to think about the private mental states of others.

Cognition, 113(3), 329-349. This article presents a computational framework for modeling human action understanding using Bayesian inverse planning. The authors conducted psychophysical experiments to assess the accuracy of different inverse planning models in predicting human goal inferences. The results show evidence for a rational inference mechanism in human goal inference. The framework provides a formal approach to understanding rational action and goal inference in humans.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a more detailed example of this project modelling theory of mind style inferences as rational inverse planning.

An experimental study of apparent behavior. The American Journal of Psychology, 57(2), 243-259. The study aimed to understand how individuals perceive and interpret the behavior of others based on visual stimuli. The authors highlight the lack of experimental investigations in this area and emphasize the importance of studying the psychology of perception in relation to apparent behavior. The study involved showing participants a moving picture-film featuring geometric shapes moving in various directions and speeds. Participants were asked to describe the pictures and answer questions about them. The findings revealed that participants tended to interpret the movements as actions of animate beings, attributing personalities and motives to the shapes. The study demonstrates that humans have a tendency to perceive and attribute behavior to abstract shapes, suggesting a fundamental psychological process involved in perceiving others\u0026rsquo; behavior.\nThis very old article is really most famous for its stimuli (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTNmLt7QX8E). One still tends to see this clip in the introduction to talks about social cognition (its not a bad idea to include it in your own presentation!). It is striking how irresistible it is to take ``the intentional stance\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; a la Dennett, and assign motivations and personality traits to these simple geometric shapes being moved around on an overhead projector.\nBaron-Cohen, S., Leslie, A. M., \u0026amp; Frith, U. (1985). Does the autistic child have a “theory of mind”? Cognition, 21(1), 37-46. This article explores whether autistic children lack a \u0026ldquo;theory of mind,\u0026rdquo; which refers to the ability to understand and predict the beliefs and behaviors of others. The study compares the performance of autistic children to that of normal children and children with Down\u0026rsquo;s syndrome using a puppet play paradigm. The research suggests that despite having a higher mental age than the comparison groups, autistic children fail to impute beliefs to others, indicating a deficit in meta-representational development specific to autism. This deficit contributes to the social impairment experienced by autistic children. The authors propose a new model of meta-representational development that suggests the capacity to form \u0026ldquo;second-order representations\u0026rdquo; is necessary for a theory of mind. Autistic children not only struggle with social ineptness but also exhibit a lack of pretend play.\nAgain this paper is most famous for its stimuli, the \u0026lsquo;Sally-Ann False Belief Task\u0026rsquo; which probes whether someone is capable of Theory of Mind reasoning. Who is Simon Baron-Cohen\u0026rsquo;s famous cousin?\nQuestions under discussion Can you think of situations where people make the wrong theory of mind ascriptions (i.e. something with little or no mental life that we we assume does have it, and visa versa)?

(2012) Symbolic representation of probabilistic worlds. Cognition, 123(1), 61-83. The article discusses the use of symbolic representation in cognitive science, specifically in probabilistic worlds. The author introduces the concept of modality and argues that symbolic representation depends on the probabilistic structure of the environment. The paper proposes that modal environments, which consist of mixtures of narrow component distributions, can be represented symbolically with minimal information loss. The author also explores the relationship between discrete symbols and continuous variables, as well as the challenges of working with mixtures. The article discusses the implications of modality in the environment and how it affects an observer\u0026rsquo;s ability to represent and comprehend it. It concludes that environments with multiple modes or peaks can be effectively represented by symbols, while arbitrary environments cannot. The paper also examines the reduction of dimensions and how modal environments can be approximated by symbolic variables. Overall, the paper aims to show that symbolic representations in cognitive science are effective in capturing the probabilistic structure of modal worlds. Harnad, S. (1990) The symbol grounding problem. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 42(1-3), 335-346. This paper by Stevan Harnad, published in 1990, explores the symbol grounding problem and the role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. It suggests that symbols can be grounded in nonsymbolic representations, such as iconic and categorical representations, in order to give them meaning. The paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of both connectionism and symbolism, and proposes a hybrid model that combines these approaches to address the limitations of each. It also discusses the transition from behaviorism to cognitivism in the modeling of the mind, and explores the defining characteristics of a symbol system. The paper concludes that addressing the symbol grounding problem is crucial for understanding complex cognitive capacities, and that a cooperative approach between connectionism and symbolism is necessary for a comprehensive cognitive model. Overall, the paper highlights the challenges and potential solutions in giving meaning to symbols within a formal symbol system, and discusses the importance of grounding symbols in nonsymbolic representations.

In class, you will may also be asked to comment on the discussion and state if you revised your belief and why. You only need to pick one of the assigned readings to reflect on with your portfolio entry (although you are welcome to comment on both, or take multiple reviewer roles if you like)\nPortfolios will be marked at the end of the semester. Five of the 20 entries can be missing, no questions asked and no detriment to the marks. Otherwise, no extensions.\nEssay Content and Format Your essay should be based around one or two papers of your choice on a topic in cognitive modelling. It must discuss empirical findings in the context of a computational model or models to a non specialist audience. The easiest way to do this is to find a single paper that includes both empirical and modelling results, but the paper in question should be very meaty, i.e., fairly long and including many experiments or a thorough comparison with other approaches. If you cannot find a suitable single paper, you can look at two shorter papers covering different models of a single phenomenon, or additional experiments testing the same model. Marking will take into account the difficulty of the chosen article(s)/theme(s), but we find that stronger essays tend to be those that focus on a single article. It\u0026rsquo;s okay to choose an older paper, but in that case you should explain how it relates to more recent work.\nYou must have your choice of paper(s) approved by 11 November 2024. Post your intended paper(s) on the Piazza note for essay topics. For help choosing papers, see the tips on the website in the first instance. If you are still having trouble, feel free to contact one of the instructors well before the deadline. Essays may not focus on papers that are the subjects of other student presentations. So make sure to look at the essay note to avoid overlapping topics.\nWhether you choose one or two main papers, your essay should discuss the context of the work (i.e., behavioural findings or philosophical questions addressed), summarise the model(s) and experiment(s), and critically evaluate the work. A good essay will include some material you get from \u0026ldquo;reading around\u0026rdquo; the topic. You may also wish to address one or more of the following questions: how does this work relate to other models/approaches we have studied in class? What questions are raised by this work? What further experimental or modelling work might help to address these questions? Your goal is to demonstrate that you can read a cognitive modelling paper, understand its methods, evaluate its claims and place it in context in the field.\nYour essay should be between 2000 and 2500 words, including headers and figure captions but not the bibliography, and should be written at a level that an interested but non-specialist reader would understand \u0026ndash; someone who has some background in cognitive science but not necessarily in the specific area you are discussing. Articles in the journal Trends in Cognitive Science, many of which have been included as background readings in this course, are good examples of this level of writing (although the format/content of these articles is different from what you will write). Do not include an abstract.\nMarking Basic Criteria Provides a clear description of the phenomena motivating the work and relevant empirical data from this and/or previous works. Clearly states hypotheses being tested by the model(s) and their relevance to the field of cognitive science. Clearly summarises the model(s), including any key technical details and assumptions that are made. Summarises key experiments and results obtained in the chosen paper(s) and explains how these bear on the hypotheses being tested. Demonstrates a detailed understanding of the chosen paper(s). Discusses strengths and weaknesses of individual model(s) and evaluation(s). Well written Additional Criteria (beyond chosen papers) Includes original discussion. Explicitly compares alternative approaches or competing hypotheses. Reviews additional behavioral evidence. Reviews other uses of the model. Relates the topic/model to broader isues and themes from the course/cognitive science or society. Proposes useful extensions to the model or further ways to test them Presentation Format Plan on presenting for 30 mins, followed by discussion/questions. We will give you time indicators and cut you off after 35 minutes regardless of whether you are done; if you aren\u0026rsquo;t, it is likely to affect your mark. You may use slides or whiteboard, but should be organized and use visuals clearly and effectively (see AV section below). Topic Assignment For the first semester, topics have been prepared for you. You should have a look at the topics on the website and fill out the survey on the first Thursday of class.\nFor the second semester, you are encouraged to propose your own topic (the website will be updated at the end of Semester 1).\nTo propose your own topic:\nyou must select one/two papers for the seminar to have people read, and have them approved by instructor. typically these should also be the topic of your essay you must draft 2+ questions under discussion Content Presentations should include:\nAn introduction to the topic: what is the psychological phenomenon being modelled, and what question(s) are being addressed in the papers? How do they tie in with some of the big questions we\u0026rsquo;ve discussed? An explanation of the models presented and results obtained. Some analysis or comparison of the models, e.g. What are their strengths and weaknesses? Do you find one more believable, and why? Are there remaining issues that neither addresses? Good presentations will also normally include examples, figures, or diagrams to illustrate important concepts or results.\nNOTE: 30 minutes is not a long time! You will need to decide how much detail is appropriate, and which information is most important. Please do not try to present everything. Remember, all students in the class should have read the assigned papers. Prepare your background material with this in mind.\nLogistics If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use your own laptop, you must email us us your slides (include the [scm-pres] tag in the subject of your email) by 7 p.m. the night before your presentation. It is a good idea to do this anyway, to ensure a backup copy in case your laptop/USB fails, and also for marking purposes. If you do not do this, and you have a technical problem that prevents you from presenting, you will receive a 0 on the assignment. We have intentionally set the deadline on the previous night so that you will not be tempted to stay up late working on your slides. Not sleeping enough is a great recipe for a poor presentation. When sending slides, PDF files are preferable. If you plan to make extensive use of the whiteboard rather than slides, you must speak to us well ahead of time (at least 4 business days). Some use of the whiteboard is fine without advance notice. Please arrive five minutes early on the day of your presentation, to allow time to set up. Delivery Part of your mark will be based on your delivery. If you wish to do well on this part of the assignment, one word will tell you how: practice! Practicing your presentation out loud will not only help you figure out how long it will take, but will also make you more confident and will allow you to work out how to explain difficult concepts ahead of time. See the marking sheet for the criteria we will be using to assess your delivery.\nHaving a well-organized talk is a very good start to keeping your audience engaged and your message understood, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to understand that people have limited memory and attention. That means they will not remember everything you said in the beginning of your talk by the end (or even the middle). You need to help them out by providing verbal cues (rarely, if ever, are bullets needed!) reminding them what you have already told them, what\u0026rsquo;s coming up, and how everything fits together. I\u0026rsquo;ve heard these referred to as \u0026ldquo;signposts\u0026rdquo;. Examples include: \u0026ldquo;OK, so that\u0026rsquo;s the overview of the system, now I will talk about each of those parts in more detail\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve now explained how they use X and Y to produce Z. Remember that what they are going to do with Z is A, so I\u0026rsquo;ll now give you some more detail about that.\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going to talk about this part of the paper in any detail, but if you have questions about it I can answer them in the discussion after the presentation.\u0026rdquo; In other words, think about your transitions, not just your slides. It is also often a good idea to include actual summary slides after each major section of your presentation, recapping the main points before moving on. You should not need more than one or two of these.\nAudio-visual aids You will also receive a mark for your use of audio-visual aids (slides, whiteboard, or any additional media). Here are some tips on appropriate use of these tools:\nPerhaps the most common mistake for beginning presenters is to put too much information (especially text) on the slides. If you practice your presentation (see above), you should know it well enough that you do not need to use the slides to remind you of every single thing you want to say. You should especially try to avoid the trap of reading text directly from your slides. Slides are better used for highlighting key points and showing pictures (examples, figures, etc.) Make sure your slides are easy to read. Fonts should be no smaller than 20-24 point. Different colors can be used for emphasis, but should be used sparingly. Remember that color-blindness is fairly common, so try not to rely on color to distinguish things. If you reproduce a figure or table from a paper, make sure any labels or text are still visible, or add your own labels in larger fonts. Sometimes it can be easier to go through an example or draw a picture on the whiteboard than on the slides. This is ok as long as you are prepared: know how the whiteboard is set up in the room and how to switch between the projector and whiteboard without taking lots of time. And know what you are planning to draw! Citations You may find that it is useful to include images, figures, or tables from the papers you are discussing or other sources. If you do so, you must cite your sources, even if the source appears to be clear from context. Papers should be cited as (Lastname, year) on the slide, with a full citation on a separate References slide at the end. Web sources should be cited by URL. Direct quotations may also be used if cited (as above), but note that long quotations are usually a crutch used by students who do not understand the material enough to restate it in their own words. Use quotations with care. Tips to avoid common mistakes The following list of pointers is intended to help avoid common pitfalls in presentations.\nExplain all important technical terms that won\u0026rsquo;t be obvious to your fellow students. Be sure to provide motivation for the models and experiments. Why did the authors do what they did? Why should we care? Make sure that fellow students who haven\u0026rsquo;t read your specific paper can still follow the presentation. Don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily describe every experiment in a paper if it would come at the cost of clarity or coherence. Always give citations for figures, quotations, and anything else you get from an external source, even if that source is the paper you\u0026rsquo;re presenting. Practice your presentation, to ensure good pacer and transitions. Don\u0026rsquo;t read directly from your slides. Only include figures or tables copied from the original paper if you can clearly explain their contents. If you\u0026rsquo;re only going to talk about a small part of the figure, it may be better to create your own.
